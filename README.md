# gromgit's Tap of New Life
This Homebrew tap hosts formulae and casks that no longer meet Homebrew guidelines, and have therefore been removed from the core tap.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/new-life/<formula_or_cask>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/new-life` and then `brew install <formula_or_cask>`.

## Why is `<formula_or_cask>` not here?
It depends:
* I don't do versioned formulae, so don't expect to see any formula with `@` in its name.
* I may not be interested in `<formula_or_cask>`.
* I may be interested in `<formula_or_cask>`, but simply haven't gotten around to it.
* FUSE-related formulae/casks are in the [`gromgit/fuse`](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-fuse) tap.
* Truly *dead* formulae (i.e. no longer maintained by upstream) are in the [`gromgit/boneyard`](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-boneyard) tap.

If you'd like to see something here, [file an issue](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-new-life/issues/new/choose) and I'll take a look.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
