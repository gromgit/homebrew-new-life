# gromgit's Tap of New Life
This Homebrew tap hosts formulae that no longer met Homebrew guidelines, and were therefore removed from the core tap.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/new-life/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/new-life` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
