# gromgit's Tap of New Life
This Homebrew tap hosts formulae that no longer met Homebrew guidelines, and were therefore removed from the core tap.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install gromgit/new-life/<formula>`

Or `brew tap gromgit/new-life` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Why is `<formula>` not here?
It depends:
* I don't do versioned formulae, so don't expect to see any formula with `@` in its name.
* I may not be interested in `<formula>`.
* I may be interested in `<formula>`, but simply haven't gotten around to it.

If you'd like to see something here, [file an issue](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-new-life/issues/new/choose) and I'll take a look.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
